# Workshopped <img src="https://travis-ci.org/ZuzannaSt/workshopped.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />

Hello there! This is my application for **Netguru Ruby on Rails workshops**. 

### Letâ€™s start with a setup:

**Source code**

Clone the repo (`git clone git@github.com:ZuzannaSt/workshopped.git` ).

**Database**

Copy the database config file (and edit if needed): 
` cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml`

Setup the database for your application:
`bin/rake db:setup`
`bin/rake db:test:prepare`

### Issues to solve:

1. Play with it. Make sure you check out `Jack White's products` which are seeded into database.

2. If you find out any bugs **feel free to tell me** - I'm here to learn.
  
3. Got any questions? Why won't you 'contact me'.
